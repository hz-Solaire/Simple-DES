bandit0: bandit0

bandit1: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If	ls cat then logout and log in b1

bandit2: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx	for files named or start with - (dashed filename), you have to cat with directory (cat ./-)

bandit3: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx	for files named with spaces in the file name, you have to use '', else the cat will distribute over the words (try to cat each word, for example: cat spaces in this filename cat: spaces: No such file or directory cat: in: No such file or directory cat: this: No such file or directory cat: filename: No such file or directory)

bandit 4: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ	for hidden files (files starting with .), use la or ls-a.

bandit 5: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw	to read what type of file we have, we use the 'file' command, we also use * to read all files, however, since all files start with -, we use the same technique as bandit 2: find ./* to find out all file types.

bandit 6: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG	find command: find -readable or -executable, -size [specify size](specify unit ex: c for bytes)
