# Simple-DES
A simplified implementation of DES that focuses on creating encryption and decryption dispatchers that use ECB, CBC and OFB modes.
The code can be broken down into 9 steps:
1- Implementation of SBOX
2- Implementation of SDES utilities
3- Construction and Configuration of SDES objects
4- SDES key handling
5- Feistel Network
6- Encryption and Decryption dispatchers
7- ECB mode (encryption and decryption)
8- CBC mode (encryption and decryption)
9- OFB mode (encryption and decryption)

We will be using 3 Libraries for this project: math, utilities and copy. The libraries have been included in the repo

This implementation is not comprehensive, nor is it intended to be. The only focus was on handling most common operations and errors.
